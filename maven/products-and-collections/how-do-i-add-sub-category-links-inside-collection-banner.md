# How do I add sub-category links inside Collection banner?

Shopify does not have a built-in sub-category system in place yet. That’s why we have to think about a smart way to allow this for merchants.

To allow this system, we parse through your navigation menu with the **handle same as your Collection handle** inside **Shopify Admin > Online Store > Navigation**:

**For example**, if you would like to create sub-category links for All products at url (collections/all), you need to create a navigation menu with “all” handle:

So, in similar fashion, to create sub-menus for “Dining & Kitchen”, we create a navigation with **dining-kitchen** handle:
