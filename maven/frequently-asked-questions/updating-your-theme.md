# Updating Your Theme

**PLEASE NOTE:** Shopify themes cannot be automatically updated. You install the latest version of a theme (for free), set it up again, and then start using it. Shopify has an article with more detail about this [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/managing-themes/updating-themes?ref=cleancanvas\&utm_campaign=support#add-an-updated-version-of-your-theme-to-your-online-store). Any custom code will need to be re-added (if needed), and some apps may need reinstalling.

Each Fuel Themes Shopify theme purchase includes all future versions of that theme. Regular releases for new versions provide bug fixes, added features, platform requirements, or other improvements.

### What does updating a theme involve? <a href="#updating-process" id="updating-process"></a>

Updating a theme is basically moving content (added images, copy, etc.) and customizations (settings, modifications, etc.) to an improved version of the theme. This is a manual process involving two separate theme files: the original theme with content and the latest version without content.

#### Why isn’t this automatic?

This process is [standard for Shopify platform themes](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/managing-themes/updating-themes).

#### I cannot see the update on my dashboard

This is [explained on the official Shopify documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/managing-themes/updating-themes).

You can update your online store themes as long as you or an installed app haven’t made any [code changes](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend) to your theme.

Any customizations made to your theme using the Theme Editor are copied over and applied to the updated theme. These include:

* Modified theme settings
* Modified page layouts, such as adding, reordering, removing, or hiding sections or blocks
* Modified theme settings
* New templates
* Added, removed, or modified settings of app embeds or app extensions

### Do I need to update my theme to the latest version?

Updating to the latest version to apply bug fixes, including new features, and keep your theme optimized with the Shopify platform.

To tell if your theme needs an update, compare your theme version to the latest release, then update if necessary.
