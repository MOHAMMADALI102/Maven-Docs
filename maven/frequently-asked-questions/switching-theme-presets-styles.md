# Switching theme presets / styles

All Shopify themes include a selection of theme presets. A theme preset is simply a saved / pre-defined selection of theme settings that have been configured to show a particular style and appearance of theme content. Those settings would include:

* Typography
* Colors
* Global options such as enabled or disabled animations
* Product grid global settings
* Product page global settings
* Cart page global settings
* Checkout styles

### Select a theme style in the theme settings

To select the theme style to use in your store, open **Theme settings**, then click the **Change theme style** button. Here you can preview the theme styles and select the one that suits your brand.

Applying and saving a new theme style will overwrite your current style settings, however, you will not lose any content from your store. That being said, it’s always a good idea to make a [backup copy ](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/managing-themes/duplicating-themes)of your theme before you start making customizations. Use the duplicate copy as your working version until you’re ready to publish it.
