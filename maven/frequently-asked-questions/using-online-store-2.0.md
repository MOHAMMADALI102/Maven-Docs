# Using Online Store 2.0

Online Store 2.0 (or OS 2.0) themes take advantage of new Shopify platform features.\
The new features are native to Shopify, and not unique to our themes, so if you have any questions about these [you can contact Shopify here](https://help.shopify.com/en/questions#/login).

Here are Shopifyâ€™s help pages for the new **admin**, **filters**, **templates,** **sections and metafields**:
